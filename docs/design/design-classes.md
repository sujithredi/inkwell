## User (entity)
- id: string
- email: string (unique)
- displayName: string
- passwordHash: string
- isVerified: boolean
- createdAt: DateTime
+ verifyPassword(plain: string): boolean
## Post (entity)
- id: string
- authorId: string
- title: string
- body: string
- status: PostStatus (DRAFT | PUBLISHED)
- publishedAt: DateTime | null
- createdAt: DateTime
+ publish(): void
+ isEditableBy(userId: string): boolean
Relationship: User "1" --> "*" Post (authors)
### Design decisions
- **Post.status uses fixed values (DRAFT, PUBLISHED), not freetext.** Catches typos like "publised" early. Tradeoff: adding ARCHIVED later requires a schema change.
- **authorId is stored directly on Post.** Each post has exactly one author, so no join table is needed; a join table would only be justified if posts could have multiple authors.
- **AuthService, not User, owns password hashing and verification.** Keeps User focused on representing user data; hashing method can change later without touching User.
