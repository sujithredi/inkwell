# Inkwell Server Module Structure — v1
## Routes / Controllers (boundary classes)
- Receive HTTP requests, call the correct service, return HTTP responses.
- Never query Prisma or the database directly.
## Services
- **AuthService** (pure fabrication) — password hashing, verification, token issuance.
- **PostService** (controller/coordinator) — business rules for posts: duplicate checks, ownership, draft/published transitions.
## Repositories (persistence classes)
- **UserRepository**, **PostRepository** — the only modules that talk to Prisma / the database directly.
## Dependency flow
Routes -> AuthService -> UserRepository -> PostgreSQL
Routes -> PostService -> PostRepository -> PostgreSQL
Modules pass simple data objects to each other; none depends on another's internal implementation details.
